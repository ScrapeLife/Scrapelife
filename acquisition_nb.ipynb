optimizations tighten schema mysql dumps disk contiguous blocks fast access use char instead varchar fixedlength fields char effectively allows fast random access whereas varchar must find end string moving onto next one use text large blocks text blog posts text also allows boolean searches using text field results storing pointer disk used locate text block use int larger numbers billion use decimal currency avoid floating point representation errors avoid storing large blobs store location get object instead varchar largest number characters counted bit number often maximizing use byte rdbms set null constraint applicable improve search performance use good indices columns querying select group order join could faster indices indices usually represented selfbalancing btree keeps data sorted allows searches sequential access insertions deletions logarithmic time placing index keep data memory requiring space writes could also slower since index also needs updated loading large
